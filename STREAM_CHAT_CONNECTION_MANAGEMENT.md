# Stream Chat Connection Management

## Overview

This document outlines the enhanced Stream Chat connection management system designed to prevent hitting usage limits, ensure proper resource cleanup, and provide optimal user experience.

## Issues Addressed

### ‚ùå **Previous Problems:**
1. **Multiple Client Instances** - Each component created its own StreamChat client
2. **Incomplete Cleanup** - Connections weren't properly closed on navigation/sign out
3. **No Connection Reuse** - New connections created even for same user
4. **Missing Global Management** - No centralized control over connections
5. **Unreliable Browser Events** - `beforeunload` often didn't fire properly
6. **No Inactivity Detection** - Connections stayed open even when users were inactive
7. **No Connection Health Monitoring** - No way to detect and recover from connection issues
8. **Race Conditions** - "You can't use a channel after client.disconnect() was called" errors
9. **WebSocket Issues** - Persistent WebSocket connection failures during reconnection
10. **Admin Dashboard Issues** - Chat logs not displaying due to RLS policy violations

### ‚úÖ **Solutions Implemented:**

## 1. Enhanced Centralized Client Manager

**File:** `src/utils/stream-chat-client.ts`

- **Singleton Pattern** - Single client manager instance across the app
- **Connection Reuse** - Reuses existing connection for same user
- **Automatic Cleanup** - Disconnects previous user when switching
- **Activity Tracking** - Monitors user interactions and disconnects after inactivity
- **Browser Event Handling** - Reliable cleanup on page hide, visibility change, network events
- **Connection Health Monitoring** - Automatic reconnection on connection loss
- **Prevention of Race Conditions** - Prevents multiple simultaneous connection attempts
- **Disconnect Callbacks** - Components can react to disconnection events
- **Client Instance Management** - Complete destruction and recreation for clean WebSocket state
- **Force Refresh Capability** - Manual connection refresh for persistent issues

```typescript
// Usage
const client = await streamChatManager.connectUser(userId, token, userData);
```

## 2. Activity-Based Connection Management

### **Inactivity Detection**
- **Timeout**: 5 minutes of inactivity triggers disconnection
- **Activity Events**: Mouse, keyboard, scroll, touch interactions
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Reconnects when user becomes active again

### **Browser Event Handling**
- **`pagehide`** - More reliable than `beforeunload` for page navigation
- **`visibilitychange`** - Handles tab switching and browser minimize
- **`online`/`offline`** - Network connectivity changes
- **`beforeunload`** - Backup cleanup for browser close

## 3. Connection Health Monitoring

### **Health Checks**
- **Frequency**: Every 30 seconds
- **Checks**: Connection state, user ID validity
- **Auto-Recovery**: Automatic reconnection on connection loss
- **Token Refresh**: Gets fresh tokens for reconnection

### **Error Recovery**
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handles connection failures gracefully
- **Retry Logic**: Delayed reconnection attempts to prevent spam
- **State Management**: Proper cleanup on connection errors

## 4. Enhanced Messaging Interface

**File:** `src/components/messaging/MessagingTab.tsx`

- **Connection Status Indicator** - Real-time connection status display
- **Activity Tracking** - Chat-specific activity monitoring
- **Better Error Handling** - Improved error states and recovery
- **Loading States** - Enhanced loading and error UI
- **Last Activity Display** - Shows when user was last active
- **Reconnection UI** - User-friendly reconnection button with force refresh option
- **Disconnect State Management** - Proper cleanup of component state on disconnection

## 5. Monitoring Tools

**Script:** `scripts/monitorStreamChat.ts`

```bash
npm run monitor-chat
```

Provides:
- Connection status and health
- Database chat activity
- Usage insights and recommendations
- Connection efficiency metrics
- Peak usage time analysis

## Connection Lifecycle

### üîÑ **Enhanced Connection Flow:**
1. **User visits Messages tab** ‚Üí Connection established
2. **User interacts** ‚Üí Activity timer reset
3. **User navigates away** ‚Üí Connection maintained (reusable)
4. **Page hidden/tab switch** ‚Üí Connection closed
5. **Network offline** ‚Üí Connection closed
6. **5 minutes inactivity** ‚Üí Connection closed
7. **User becomes active** ‚Üí Auto-reconnection
8. **User signs out** ‚Üí Connection closed
9. **Page unloads** ‚Üí Connection closed
10. **Different user signs in** ‚Üí Previous connection closed, new one established

### üìä **Usage Optimization:**
- **MAU (Monthly Active Users)** - Each unique user counts once per month
- **Concurrent Connections** - Peak simultaneous connections
- **Connection Reuse** - Same user doesn't create multiple connections
- **Automatic Cleanup** - Connections closed when not needed
- **Activity-Based Management** - Connections only active when user is engaged

## Configuration

### **Timeout Settings**
```typescript
const INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes
const RECONNECT_DELAY = 2000; // 2 seconds
const HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL = 30000; // 30 seconds
```

### **Activity Events Tracked**
- `mousedown`, `mousemove`, `keypress`, `scroll`, `touchstart`, `click`

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ **Do:**
- Use the centralized `streamChatManager`
- Let the manager handle connection lifecycle
- Monitor usage with `npm run monitor-chat`
- Check Stream Chat dashboard regularly
- Trust the automatic cleanup mechanisms

### ‚ùå **Don't:**
- Create multiple StreamChat instances
- Manually call `disconnectUser()` in components
- Forget to handle sign out scenarios
- Ignore connection monitoring
- Override the activity tracking

## Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Test chat creation and connections
npm run test-chat

# Monitor current usage and health
npm run monitor-chat

# Close expired chats
npm run close-chats
```

## Stream Chat Dashboard

Monitor your usage at: https://dashboard.getstream.io/

Key metrics to watch:
- **Monthly Active Users (MAU)**
- **Peak Concurrent Connections**
- **Connection patterns**
- **Connection efficiency**

## Cost Optimization

1. **Connection Reuse** - Prevents unnecessary connections
2. **Automatic Cleanup** - Closes connections when not needed
3. **Activity-Based Management** - Only maintains connections during active use
4. **Browser Event Handling** - Ensures connections are closed on navigation
5. **Health Monitoring** - Prevents orphaned connections

## Troubleshooting

### High Connection Count:
1. Check if users are properly signing out
2. Verify cleanup component is working
3. Monitor with `npm run monitor-chat`
4. Check Stream Chat dashboard for connection patterns
5. Review inactivity timeout settings

### Connection Errors:
1. Verify environment variables
2. Check token generation
3. Ensure proper user authentication
4. Review browser console for errors
5. Check network connectivity

### Reconnection Issues:
1. Check for "You can't use a channel after client.disconnect() was called" errors
2. Verify disconnect callbacks are working properly
3. Test force refresh functionality
4. Check WebSocket cleanup in browser console
5. Monitor client instance destruction and recreation

### Inactivity Issues:
1. Verify activity events are being tracked
2. Check inactivity timeout configuration
3. Monitor activity logs in browser console
4. Test with different user interaction patterns

## Performance Impact

### **Memory Usage**
- Reduced memory footprint through connection reuse
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Efficient state management

### **Network Usage**
- Reduced unnecessary reconnections
- Optimized token refresh
- Better error handling reduces retry attempts

### **User Experience**
- Seamless reconnection on activity
- Real-time connection status
- Graceful error handling
- No interruption during normal usage
