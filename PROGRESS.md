## Development Notes
- The app uses Clerk for authentication with Supabase for data storage
- Email templates are stored in `templates/emails/`
- Admin functionality is restricted to users with admin role
- Profile completion is required before accessing main features
- Location-based matching uses geocoding API
- **Database schema and RLS rules are documented in `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`**

## Environment Setup
Required environment variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `RESEND_API_KEY`
- `GEOCODING_API_KEY`

## Next Session Context
When resuming development, focus on:
1. Testing the complete user workflow
2. Identifying and fixing any edge cases
3. Performance optimization
4. Documentation updates
