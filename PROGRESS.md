- **Database State**: Fixed current database state where expired chats were incorrectly marked as active
- **Investigation Tools**: Created and used investigation scripts to identify and resolve chat status issues
- **Manual Cleanup**: Successfully closed expired chats that were incorrectly left active
- **System Validation**: Verified chat status logic now works consistently across admin and user interfaces

### COMPLETED: Admin Unread Message Alerts
- **Custom Hook**: Created `useAdminUnreadCount()` to fetch total unread message count
- **Desktop Navigation**: Added red "!" alert badge to "Chat Management" menu item in admin sidebar
- **Mobile Navigation**: Enhanced mobile nav for admin users with unread alert on "Chats" tab
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic polling every 15 seconds to check for new unread messages
- **Smart Functionality**: Alert clears when admin views chat management page or selects a chat
- **Visual Design**: Static red badge positioned horizontally centered on menu text (no animation)
- **Cross-platform**: Consistent alert system across desktop and mobile admin interfaces
- **Performance**: Efficient API calls using existing admin chats endpoint

### COMPLETED: Admin Chat Tabbed Interface
- **Tabbed Layout**: Implemented separate tabs for "Active" and "Closed" chats using Radix UI tabs
- **Visual Counters**: Added badges showing count of chats in each tab (blue for active, gray for closed)
- **Status Filtering**: Automatic filtering based on chat status (active/closed) with search integration
- **Improved UX**: Clear separation between ongoing and completed conversations
- **Responsive Design**: Maintains 1/3 + 2/3 layout with tabbed chat list
- **Empty States**: Appropriate messaging for each tab when no chats are found
- **Search Integration**: Search functionality works across both active and closed chat tabs
- **Real-time Updates**: Tab counts update automatically with polling system
- **Refresh System**: Integrated callback system to update alerts when chats are marked as read

### COMPLETED: PWA Manifest Enhancements for iOS/Android

- **Availability Filtering Logic**: Documented how the system filters availability slots based on time, visibility, and appointment status
- **Hidden Slots Management**: Discovered that availability slots can be hidden when appointments are made/cancelled, affecting search results
- **Time-Based Filtering**: Confirmed system correctly filters out past availability and only shows future slots
- **Search Function Validation**: Verified that `get_nearby_dogs_with_availability` and related database functions work correctly
